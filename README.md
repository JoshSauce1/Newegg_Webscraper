# Newegg Webscraper
## This Python script searches for a product on Newegg.com and retrieves the price and link for each item in the search results. 
The items are then sorted by price and printed out in ascending order. Case Study PP: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1u9nC-gGydIPzV2WBeu8XxbffchfhpUupPTBh5CP8IUg/edit?usp=sharing
## This project's goal is to practice web scraping & Python, and was inspired by my interest in building a PC in my free time.
